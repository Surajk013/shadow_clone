V0.1 - WORKS
This script is inspired by bugswriter and JaKooLit.
The dwm used is a fork of bugswriter's dwm package and 
hyprland used if JaKooLit's Arch-Hyprland [ which is the most perfectly maintained hyprland repo I have come across ]

TODO
1.Automation - there are parts in between the script where user intervention is required
2.Generalisation - Right now it is only personalised to fit my needs [ may fir yours ]
3.Begineer friendly - I haven't made a guide nor comments that would help a begineer.
4.Verification - Since this is a linear scripts I have to make sure that one module of the script is successful to process for the successive module
